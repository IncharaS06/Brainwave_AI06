# Brainwave_AI06 🌪️

A smart and scalable **Disaster Management System** developed during **Infothon 2.0**, a 24-hour national-level hackathon. This project was built to assist emergency response teams, predict disaster risks, and streamline communication during natural calamities.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Brainwave_AI06 is an AI-powered disaster management platform that combines real-time data analysis, prediction models, and intuitive user interfaces to help authorities and civilians act swiftly and efficiently during crisis situations.

### Key Features

- 📡 **Real-Time Monitoring**: Pulls in data from various sources including weather APIs, news feeds, and local alerts.
- 🧠 **AI-Based Prediction**: Utilizes machine learning models to assess potential threats and forecast disaster patterns.
- 📍 **Geolocation & Mapping**: Interactive maps for visualizing affected areas and tracking safe zones.
- 📢 **Alert System**: Sends timely alerts and notifications to both authorities and users.
- 🤝 **Resource Coordination**: Facilitates allocation of essential supplies and rescue operations.

## 🎯 Motivation

The frequency of natural disasters is increasing, yet communication and preparedness often lag behind. This system was built to bridge that gap and offer an intelligent, accessible, and proactive solution for disaster mitigation.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Python** & **Flask** – Backend & API Integration
- **JavaScript** & **React.js** – Frontend Development
- **Google Maps API** – Location Services
- **Scikit-learn / TensorFlow** – Machine Learning
- **Firebase** – Authentication & Notification System

## 🎓 Hackathon Participation

Developed during **Infothon 2.0**, a 24-hour national-level hackathon, this project was a collaborative effort focused on real-world problem solving. Our goal was to create a functioning prototype that could scale in real-world disaster relief scenarios.
